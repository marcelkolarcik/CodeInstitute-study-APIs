# Code Institute

Welcome USER_NAME,

We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started.

To run a frontend application in GitPod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Expose*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Expose*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
